# landing-page
TOP landing page project

Did fairly well, could use some media queries and other responsive elements to make it more user freindly but all in all a decent job.

I really focused on flex box and its usages, I could probably rework the header using the "flex" property.

The only thing I googled was the copywrite symbol.

One thing i want to work on is trying to order of the styles consistent, ie always putting height above width, i frequently just added the next style to the end of the list without much regard to how the code looked.
